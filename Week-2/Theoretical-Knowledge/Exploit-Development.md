# Exploit Development

## 1. Introduction

Exploit development is the process of creating code or techniques to take advantage of security vulnerabilities in software or systems. It is an advanced domain of cybersecurity used for research, testing, and defensive analysis.
Ethical exploit development is conducted in controlled lab environments to understand vulnerabilities and build stronger defenses.

## 2. Types of Exploits

1. Remote Exploits

- Can be executed over a network
- High risk due to no physical access requirement

2. Local Exploits

- Require local access
- Often used for privilege escalation

3. Client-Side Exploits

- Target browsers or applications
- Rely on user interaction

## 3. Common Vulnerabilities Used in Exploits

- Buffer Overflows
- Format String Vulnerabilities
- Use-After-Free
- SQL Injection

## 4. Exploit Development Lifecycle

1. Vulnerability discovery
2. Vulnerability analysis
3. Proof-of-concept creation
4. Reliability testing
5. Patch development
6. Disclosure and mitigation

## 5. Role of Exploit Development in Security

- Helps validate security fixes
- Enhances defensive controls
- Improves intrusion detection systems
- Supports advanced penetration testing

## 6. Conclusion

Exploit development is a double-edged discipline that must be handled responsibly. When used ethically, it strengthens cybersecurity defenses by exposing weaknesses and guiding secure software development practices.
