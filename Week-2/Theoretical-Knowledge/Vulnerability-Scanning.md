## Vulnerability Scanning

# Introduction

Vulnerability scanning is the process of automatically identifying security weaknesses in systems, networks, applications, and devices. These weaknesses may be due to misconfigurations, outdated software, open ports, weak services, or known vulnerabilities (CVEs) that attackers can exploit.
The main objective of vulnerability scanning is to detect vulnerabilities before an attacker does, enabling organizations to fix issues proactively and reduce security risks.

# Types of Vulnerability Scanning

# 1. Network-Based Scanning

- Identifies open ports, running services, and exposed devices.
- Detects outdated services and weak configurations.

# 2. Host-Based Scanning

- Analyzes individual systems for missing patches, weak passwords, and insecure settings.

# 3. Web Application Scanning

- Focuses on vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, and insecure authentication.

# 4. Authenticated vs Unauthenticated Scans

- Authenticated scans provide deeper visibility using credentials.

- Unauthenticated scans simulate an external attacker’s perspective.

# Vulnerability Life Cycle

1. Discovery of vulnerability
2. Assignment of CVE ID
3. Risk scoring using CVSS
4. Detection by scanners
5. Patch or mitigation
6. Verification through rescan

# Importance of Vulnerability Scanning

1. Helps maintain system confidentiality, integrity, and availability
2. Assists in compliance with security standards
3. Reduces the attack surface
4. Supports risk-based decision making
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Limitations

1. Can produce false positives
2. Does not confirm exploitability
3. Requires human validation
4. Cannot replace penetration testing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Conclusion

Vulnerability scanning is a foundational security practice that provides visibility into system weaknesses. While it does not confirm exploitation, it is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and forms the first step of a comprehensive security assessment.
