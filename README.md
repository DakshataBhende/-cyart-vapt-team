# Week 2 – Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)

## 1. Project Overview

This repository documents Week-2 Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) activities performed in a controlled laboratory environment.
The objective is to understand reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, exploitation basics, risk analysis, and reporting while following ethical and guidelines.

## 2. Scope

- Target: Local lab virtual machines (e.g., Metasploitable2, DVWA)
- Testing Type: Internal VAPT
- Environment: Isolated lab setup

## 3. Tools Used

- Nmap – Network and service scanning
- Nikto – Web application vulnerability scanning
- OpenVAS – Automated vulnerability assessment
- Shodan – OSINT reconnaissance (theoretical / simulation)
- Metasploit – Exploitation simulation
- sqlmap – SQL injection testing
- Google Docs / PDF – Documentation and reporting

## 4. Complete Workflow

### 1. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)

### Objective:
- Gather initial information about the target to understand its attack surface.

### Steps:
- Perform OSINT study using Shodan (simulated / theoretical).
- Identify exposed services, ports, and technologies.
- Map available information related to the target.
- Document all findings.

### Output:
- IP address details
- Exposed services
- Technology stack information
