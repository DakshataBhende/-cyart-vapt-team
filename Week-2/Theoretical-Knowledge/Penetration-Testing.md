# Penetration Testing

## 1. Introduction

Penetration testing is an authorized simulated cyberattack performed to evaluate the security of systems, networks, and applications. Unlike vulnerability scanning, penetration testing aims to actively exploit vulnerabilities to determine their real-world impact.
The goal is to identify how attackers can breach systems and what damage they can cause.

## 2. Types of Penetration Testing

1. Black Box Testing

- Tester has no prior knowledge of the system.
- Simulates an external attacker.

2. White Box Testing

- Tester has full knowledge (source code, credentials).
- Provides deep coverage.

3. Gray Box Testing

- Partial knowledge provided.
- Balanced and commonly used.

## 3. Phases of Penetration Testing

1. Reconnaissance

- Information gathering (IPs, domains, services)
- Scanning & Enumeration
- Identifying open ports, running services, versions

2. Vulnerability Analysis

- Mapping weaknesses to known vulnerabilities
  
3. Exploitation

- Attempting to exploit vulnerabilities safely

4. Post-Exploitation

- Privilege escalation, lateral movement analysis

5. Reporting

- Documentation of findings and remediation steps

## 4. Importance of Penetration Testing

- Validates real-world exploitability
- Prioritizes critical vulnerabilities
- Improves incident response preparedness
- Required for high-security environments

## 5. Conclusion

Penetration testing provides practical assurance of system security. It complements vulnerability scanning by demonstrating how vulnerabilities can be chained and exploited, helping organizations understand and mitigate real attack risks.
